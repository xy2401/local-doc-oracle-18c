==============
BEFORE UPGRADE
==============

  REQUIRED ACTIONS
  ================
  None

  RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
  ===================
  1.  (AUTOFIXUP) Gather stale data dictionary statistics prior to database
      upgrade in off-peak time using:

        EXECUTE DBMS_STATS.GATHER_DICTIONARY_STATS;

      Dictionary statistics do not exist or are stale (not up-to-date).

      Dictionary statistics help the Oracle optimizer find efficient SQL
      execution plans and are essential for proper upgrade timing. Oracle
      recommends gathering dictionary statistics in the last 24 hours before
      database upgrade.

      For information on managing optimizer statistics, refer to the 12.2.0.1
      Oracle Database SQL Tuning Guide.

  2.  (AUTOFIXUP) Gather statistics on fixed objects prior the upgrade.

      None of the fixed object tables have had stats collected.

      Gathering statistics on fixed objects, if none have been gathered yet, is
      recommended prior to upgrading.

      For information on managing optimizer statistics, refer to the 12.2.0.1
      Oracle Database SQL Tuning Guide.

  INFORMATION ONLY
  ================
  3.  To help you keep track of your tablespace allocations, the following
      AUTOEXTEND tablespaces are expected to successfully EXTEND during the
      upgrade process.

                                                 Min Size
      Tablespace                        Size     For Upgrade
      ----------                     ----------  -----------
      SYSAUX                             480 MB       692 MB
      SYSTEM                             800 MB      1243 MB
      TEMP                               131 MB       150 MB
      UNDOTBS1                            70 MB       439 MB

      Minimum tablespace sizes for upgrade are estimates.

  4.  No action needed.

      Using default parallel upgrade options, this CDB with 2 PDBs will first
      upgrade the CDB$ROOT, and then upgrade at most 1 PDBs at a time using 2
      parallel processes per PDB.

      The number of PDBs upgraded in parallel and the number of parallel
      processes per PDB can be adjusted as described in Database Upgrade Guide.

  ORACLE GENERATED FIXUP SCRIPT
  =============================
  All of the issues in database CDB12 container CDB$ROOT
  which are identified above as BEFORE UPGRADE "(AUTOFIXUP)" can be resolved by
  executing the following from within the container

    SQL>@/u01/app/oracle/cfgtoollogs/cdb12/preupgrade/preupgrade_fixups.sql

=============
AFTER UPGRADE
=============

  REQUIRED ACTIONS
  ================
  None

  RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
  ===================
  5.  Upgrade the database time zone file using the DBMS_DST package.

      The database is using time zone file version 26 and the target 18.0.0.0.0
      release ships with time zone file version 31.

      Oracle recommends upgrading to the desired (latest) version of the time
      zone file.  For more information, refer to "Upgrading the Time Zone File
      and Timestamp with Time Zone Data" in the 18.0.0.0.0 Oracle Database
      Globalization Support Guide.

  6.  (AUTOFIXUP) Gather dictionary statistics after the upgrade using the
      command:

        EXECUTE DBMS_STATS.GATHER_DICTIONARY_STATS;

      Oracle recommends gathering dictionary statistics after upgrade.

      Dictionary statistics provide essential information to the Oracle
      optimizer to help it find efficient SQL execution plans. After a database
      upgrade, statistics need to be re-gathered as there can now be tables
      that have significantly changed during the upgrade or new tables that do
      not have statistics gathered yet.

  7.  Gather statistics on fixed objects after the upgrade and when there is a
      representative workload on the system using the command:

        EXECUTE DBMS_STATS.GATHER_FIXED_OBJECTS_STATS;

      This recommendation is given for all preupgrade runs.

      Fixed object statistics provide essential information to the Oracle
      optimizer to help it find efficient SQL execution plans.  Those
      statistics are specific to the Oracle Database release that generates
      them, and can be stale upon database upgrade.

      For information on managing optimizer statistics, refer to the 12.2.0.1
      Oracle Database SQL Tuning Guide.
