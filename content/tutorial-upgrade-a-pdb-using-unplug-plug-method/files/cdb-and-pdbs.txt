This illustration shows a CDB with a CDB$ROOT container, a PDB$SEED container plugged into the root, and several PDBs plugged into the root. One PDB is a new PDB. The illustration shows the database files and the XML metadata file of the new PDB. A CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE ... USING statement uses these copied files to create the new PDB.
